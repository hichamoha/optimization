# Optimization
Optimization theory is applied in many areas:
* Telecommunications, e.g. Base station placement
* Signal processing, e.g. Speech recognition
* Control theory, e.g. Trajectory planning
* Economy, e.g. Portfolio optimization
* Logistics, e.g. Production chain management
* Medicine, e.g. Radiation therapy planning

## Contents
Quadratic forms and matrix factorisation. Convexity. The theory of optimization with
and without constraints
### Methods for Optimization without Constraints (Unconstrained Optimization) (chap. 2-3)
Algorithms to find an approximate minimizer: : line search, steepest descent, Newton methods,
conjugate directions, non-linear least squares optimization.

### Methods for Constrained Optimization (chap. 4-8)
Lagrange functions, KKT theory, Duality

### Penalty and Barrier Functions (chap. 9)
Convert *constrained* *non-linear* optimization problem (P) to unconstrained and use algorithms.
